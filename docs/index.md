# MedGraph

## Project Summary
Find all data that has any relevance to the medical space and bring that data together in one place. The ability to build a system that is automatically pulling together data from multiple sources along with running real time analytics whilst allowing users to interact with the platform from a Graphical User Interface.

This project has potential to be in front of the Center for Disease Control, Veterans Affairs, World Health Organizations, Fast Health Interoperability Resources, and many other health organizations. 

Itâ€™s because of this that I believe this project will serve as a launch pad to your careers, and if you are already a consultant this project will allow you to demonstrate the full capabilities of what the product is you are trying to sell.
